# Gallery Example Rule

Whenever you implement **any new plot feature or chart type** in LeanPlot, add a corresponding demo entry to the gallery so users can discover it quickly.

The demo should live under `LeanPlot/Demos/` and be linked in [Gallery.md](mdc:Gallery.md).  Prefer the naming convention `<FeatureName>Demo.lean`.
