# Debugging Charts with Image Snapshots

When you are **debugging a new chart component** or tweaking visual details, generate a quick PNG snapshot so you can inspect the exact rendering independent of VS Code's Infoview.

* Use the existing `mcp_Playwright_playwright_screenshot` tool or `Recharts`' built-in export.
* Save images under `docs/img/` with the naming scheme `<Module>-<Feature>-<step>.png`.
* Link the snapshot from the relevant Markdown docs (e.g. [`README.md`](mdc:README.md) or [`Gallery.md`](mdc:Gallery.md)) so future contributors can see the before/after.

This practice helps catch off-by-one pixel issues and colour-palette regressions that are hard to notice in the live preview alone.
