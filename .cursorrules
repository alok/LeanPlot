Goal: Implement a basic plotting library in the infoview in Lean4 using https://github.com/leanprover-community/ProofWidgets4

Install it (I have npm, so that's not an issue). They have some Recharts integration mentioned, so look at the source code in `.lake/` for a source of truth.

checklist (fill in as you go):

- [ ] y = x
- [ ] y=x^2
- [ ] multiple plots in one graph
 
Base everything on floats in the end.

I aspire to a grammar of graphics big plotting library, but gotta start somewhere.
